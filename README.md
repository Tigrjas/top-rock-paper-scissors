# Rock Paper Scissors

This is a simple Rock Paper Scissors game built as part of the [JavaScript Foundations curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/rock-paper-scissors) on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to implement a basic version of the Rock Paper Scissors game using JavaScript, reinforcing fundamental programming concepts such as:

- Variables and data types  
- Functions and control flow  
- User input and interaction (via `prompt()` or DOM, depending on implementation stage)  
- Random number generation  
- Basic conditional logic

This project provides hands-on practice with JavaScript syntax and problem-solving skills, and it serves as a foundation for more complex applications later in the curriculum.

## Features

- A functional game loop that allows a user to play against the computer  
- Logic to determine a winner based on standard Rock Paper Scissors rules  
- Score tracking and game-ending conditions (if implemented)  
- Console-based or UI-based user interface, depending on the stage of completion

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the source files.  
2. Open the HTML file in a web browser.  
3. Open the browser console to interact with the game (for console-based version).  
4. For UI version, play directly via buttons and on-screen prompts.

## Project Status

This project is currently complete as per the guidelines of The Odin Project's Foundations curriculum. Future improvements may include:

- Enhanced UI with animations or sound  
- Score history and persistent game stats  
- Multiplayer support
